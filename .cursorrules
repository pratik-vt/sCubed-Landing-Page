# S Cubed Landing Page - Cursor Rules Configuration

This project uses modular Cursor rules organized in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## Active Rule Sets:

### Project-Specific Rules
- **scubed-project.mdc** - S Cubed Landing Page specific standards and conventions
- **nextjs.mdc** - Next.js 15 best practices and patterns

### Technology-Specific Rules  
- **react.mdc** - React best practices for Next.js applications
- **typescript.mdc** - TypeScript coding standards and conventions
- **clean-code.mdc** - General clean code principles and guidelines

## Project Context

**Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
**Styling**: Vanilla Extract CSS-in-JS
**Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
**Deployment**: AWS Amplify (static export)
**Architecture**: Component-driven with design tokens

## Key Conventions

- Use Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- Follow existing component structure in `src/components/`
- Use Vanilla Extract for all styling with design tokens
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- No manual React imports (Next.js handles automatically)
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side environment variables
- Test builds regularly with static export configuration

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build & Test
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint

# Environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables for client-side access
```
