        {
          question:
            'What is prior authorization management software and how does it work?',
          answer:
            'Prior authorization management software streamlines the process of securing insurance approval for ABA services. It automates submissions, tracks real-time request statuses, and ensures all required clinical documentation and service codes like CPT 97151 or 97153 are included. For ABA providers, this means faster authorizations, fewer administrative burdens, and uninterrupted care delivery.',
        },
        {
          question:
            'How does prior authorization software help reduce claim denials in ABA therapy?',
          answer:
            'Effective prior authorization tools are designed to proactively address common denial triggers in ABA therapy such as incorrect code pairings or missing documentation. Using predictive analytics and payer-specific rules, the software alerts staff to potential issues before submission. This reduces avoidable denials, lowers rework, and accelerates reimbursement.',
        },
        {
          question:
            'What features should a good prior authorization software have?',
          answer:
            'Key features should include Real-time insurance eligibility and benefits verification, ABA-specific CPT and diagnosis code mapping, Automated workflows for initial and renewal authorizations, seamless integration with ABA billing, EMR, and practice management systems. Look for platforms that automate not just the request, but the entire lifecycle of an authorization.',
        },
        {
          question:
            'How does S Cubed help with tracking authorizations and renewals?',
          answer:
            'S Cubed consolidates all authorization statuses and renewal timelines into a single, intuitive dashboard. It sends automated alerts before authorizations expire and provides advanced tools to manage reauthorizations ensuring continuity of care and uninterrupted billing cycles for your ABA clients.',
        },

        {
          question:
            'What are predictive alerts, and how do they improve ABA prior authorization management?',
          answer:
            'Predictive alerts leverage historical denial data and payer trends to flag authorization requests that are likely to be rejected. For ABA practices, this means identifying issues like code mismatches or missing treatment plans before submission, saving time, improving approval rates, and supporting cleaner claims downstream.',
        },
        {
          question:
            'Why are CPT and diagnosis code mappings crucial in ABA therapy authorization?',
          answer:
            'ABA services must use proper combinations of CPT (e.g. 97155, 97156) and ICD-10 (e.g. F84.0) codes based on payer rules. Proper code mapping ensures compliance, reduces payer pushback, and speeds up approvals. Software that includes intelligent code-mapping tools reduces human error while boosting performance metrics.',
        },
        {
          question:
            'Can ABA prior authorization software integrate with billing and EMR systems?',
          answer:
            'Yes. A strong authorization system integrates natively with your ABA practice management, billing, and EMR systems, enabling seamless data flow. This eliminates manual data entry, reduces administrative overhead, and supports end-to-end revenue cycle optimization.',
        },
        {
          question:
            'How does real-time visibility of authorization statuses reduce scheduling conflicts in ABA practices?',
          answer:
            'With real-time visibility, staff is immediately aware of whether a session is authorized before scheduling or at the point of service. This prevents last-minute cancellations, improves patient and family satisfaction, and helps clinicians focus on delivering care, not chasing approvals.',
